# Welcome

This folder has been created to contain useful commands and observations that correlated to the original [guide](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/basic-operators.html)

## Basic operators

```sh
# In the previous chapter, we saw Elixir provides +, -, *, / as arithmetic operators, plus the functions div/2 and rem/2 for integer division and remainder

# Elixir also provides ++ and -- to manipulate lists
iex(1)> [1, 2, 3] ++ [4, 5, 6]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
iex(2)> [1, 2, 3] -- [2]
[1, 3]

# String concatenation is done with <>
iex(3)> "foo" <> "bar"
"foobar"

# Elixir also provides three boolean operators: or, and and not. These operators are strict in the sense that they expect something that evaluates to a boolean (true or false) as their first argument
iex(5)> true and true
true
iex(6)> false or is_atom(:example)
true

# Providing a non-boolean will raise an exception
iex(7)> 1 and true
** (BadBooleanError) expected a boolean on left-side of "and", got: 1

# or and and are short-circuit operators. They only execute the right side if the left side is not enough to determine the result
iex(8)> false and raise("This error will never be raised")
false
iex(9)> true or raise("This error will never be raised")
true

# Besides these boolean operators, Elixir also provides ||, && and ! which accept arguments of any type. For these operators, all values except false and nil will evaluate to true
iex(11)> 1 || true
1
iex(12)> false || 11
11
iex(13)> nil && 13
nil
iex(14)> true && 17
17
iex(15)> !true
false
iex(16)> !1
false
iex(17)> !nil
true
# As a rule of thumb, use and, or and not when you are expecting booleans. If any of the arguments are non-boolean, use &&, || and !

# Elixir also provides ==, !=, ===, !==, <=, >=, < and > as comparison operators
iex(19)> 1 == 1
true
iex(20)> 1 != 2
true
iex(21)> 1 < 2
true

# The difference between == and === is that the latter is more strict when comparing integers and floats
iex(23)> 1 == 1.0
true
iex(24)> 1 === 1.0
false

# In Elixir, we can compare two different data types
iex(26)> 1 < :atom
true
```

What? Yes. It's true. The reason we can compare different data types is pragmatism. Sorting algorithms donâ€™t need to worry about different data types in order to sort. The overall sorting order is defined below:

`number < atom < reference < function < port < pid < tuple < map < list < bitstring`
