# Welcome

This project is meant to serve as a starting point for exploring [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org).

## Getting started

Since I'm developing on macOS, I've included a cheat sheet that should get you up and running. If you're hell-bent on seeing your platform here, please don't hesitate to create a pull request.

For instructions on installing [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), please refer to the guide available at [https://elixir-lang.org/install.html](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).

### macOS

To install [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) on macOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```sh
$ brew update
$ brew install elixir

# If Elixir has already been installed, you may be instructed to upgrade to the latest version
$ brew upgrade elixir

# Verify Elixir has been installed successfully
$ elixir -v
Erlang/OTP 22 [erts-10.5.2] [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [ds:8:8:10] [async-threads:1] [hipe] [dtrace]

Elixir 1.9.2 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 22)
```
